## 🛠️ Proof of Work (Open Source Contributions)

### 🛡️ Security & System Reliability
* **Project-HAMi ([#1620](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/pull/1620))**: Implemented DoS protection by introducing `io.LimitReader` to scheduler routes, preventing resource exhaustion from oversized payloads.
* **Gogs ([#8091](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/8091))**: Engineered safety checks to ensure data integrity by verifying directory existence before repository initialization.
* **Syncthing ([#10541](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/10541))**: Enhanced system transparency by ensuring full device ID logging during discovery server startup.

### 🚀 Core Logic & Feature Engineering
* **Google ([go-github #3891](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/3891))**: Implemented `omitzero` support for `BypassActors`, leveraging new Go 1.24 features for more efficient API data handling.
* **Google ([go-github #3944](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/3944))**: Added support for organization artifact metadata APIs, including deployment/storage record endpoints with full test coverage.
* **Apache ([answer #1464](https://github.com/apache/answer/pull/1464))**: Added support for `.env` configurations to allow for dynamic, environment-specific application setups.
* **Gogs ([#8089](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/8089))**: Developed custom post-sign-out redirection logic to streamline user authentication workflows.
* **Syncthing ([#10527](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/10527))**: Standardized version output logic in the discovery server to improve CLI consistency.

### 🐛 Optimization & User Experience
* **ChainSafe ([lodestar #8298](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/8298))**: Optimized Ethereum consensus client logging for higher performance and cleaner telemetry data.
* **Termix-SSH ([#182](https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Termix/pull/182))**: Integrated dynamic versioning for CLI menus using environment variables.
* **OHC Network ([#12197](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/pull/12197))**: Resolved critical responsiveness issues in healthcare clinical modules.
* **Memos ([#5323](https://github.com/usememos/memos/pull/5323))**: Enhanced UI accessibility and dark-mode contrast for improved user experience.
* **Project-HAMi ([#1628](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/pull/1628))**: Fixed Prometheus metric cardinality explosion by optimizing container memory descriptor labels, reducing excessive time-series generation and improving monitoring stability.
